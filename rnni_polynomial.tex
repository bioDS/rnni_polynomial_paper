\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
A classical result in mathematical phylogenetics states that the problem of finding shortest paths between phylogenetic trees is NP-hard for all standard tree-rearrangement operations.
However, this problem is open for ranked phylogenetic trees, the main object of interest in evolutionary biology.
In this paper we settle this problem by establishing that the complexity depends on the weight difference between different tree rearrangement operations and varies from quadratic to NP-hard.

\summary{Motivation: many popular tree search algorithms are based on NNI (e.g. this \url{https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/28/10/2731/973375} tool has been cited 40K+ times, see also references there to PhyML, RaxML, etc. -- they all use NNI); other applications include tree comparison methods, tree inference methods (proposal distributions), summary statistics, etc.}
The problem of reconstructing evolutionary histories given sequence data is central for many tree inference methods used in computational evolutionary biology.
Some of the most popular methods infer trees from sequences via maximum likelihood \autocite{Stamatakis2006-xb, Guindon2010-lo}, MCMC \autocite{Ronquist2003-eq, Suchard2018-tw, Bouckaert2019-yr}, distance- and parsimony-based approaches \autocite{Tamura2011-ky}.
All these methods rely of various tree rearrangement operations \autocite{Semple2003-nj}, the most popular of which are nearest neighbour interchange ($\nni$), subtree prune and regraft ($\spr$), and tree bisection and reconnection($\tbr$).
The tree inference problem hence can be formulated as a graph search, where vertices are trees and edges are given by the tree rearrangement operation of interest.

\summary{Motivation: However, all known graph-based tree rearrangement distances, including NNI, are NP-hard, and it took many years and paper to prove that; so approach such as practical FPT algorithms is an active area of research to overcome the computational (cite Whidden).}
Classical results in mathematical phylogenetics imply that computing rearrangement distances between trees, that is, the minimum number of tree rearrangements necessary to convert one tree into another, is $\np$-hard \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa, Bordewich2005-nx, Hickey2008-wv, Allen2001-ky} for all the three rearrangement operations, $\nni$, $\spr$, and $\tbr$.
We will formally introduce all necessary definitions later in the paper.
Intuitively, the difference between the three operations is how much change can be done to a tree by a single operation, with $\nni$ being the most local type of rearrangement and $\tbr$ the most global one.
Remarkably, it took over 25 years and a number of published erroneous attempts, as discussed in detail by \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa}, to prove the result that it is $\np$-hard to compute distances between trees under the $\nni$ operation \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.
Similarly for $\spr$, before \textcite{Bordewich2005-nx} proved the $\np$-hardness result for rooted trees and \textcite{Hickey2008-wv} utilised this proof to establish the result for unrooted trees, incorrect proofs have been discussed in the literature \autocite{Hein1996-em, Allen2001-ky}.
To facilitate practical applications, several fixed parameter tractable algorithms for computing the $\spr$ distance have been developed over the years \autocite{Whidden2010-bw, Bordewich2005-nx, Whidden2018-fw}.
Although these algorithm advanced the applicability of the methods significantly, they remain impractical for large distances and are applied to trees with a moderate number of leaves or those with small distances.
It is still open whether the fixed parameter tractability result holds in $\nni$, so the algorithms for computing shortest paths in $\nni$ remain largely impractical.
This is an active area of research in modern computational phylogenetics \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.

\summary{Historically, the complexity question was following hand in hand with the cluster property -- more history plus biological relevance of the property.}
The idea utilised by \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa} to prove that the $\nni$ distance is $\np$-hard stems from a result that shortest paths in $\nni$ do not preserve clusters \autocite{Li1996-zw}, that is, two trees sharing a cluster does not imply that all trees along a shortest path have that cluster.
We will say that $\nni$ does not have the cluster property (see below for a formal description).
Not only this counter-intuitive property eventually led to the computational hardness result, the property made little sense biologically as trees clustering the same set of sequences into a subtree should be closer to each other than to a tree that does not have that subtree.
Indeed, a shared cluster means that both trees support the hypothesis that this cluster has evolved along a subtree.
It was believed that the cluster property and the computational complexity of computing distances were related \autocite{Li1996-zw}, so the two questions have historically been studied simultaneously \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.
However, there is little evidence to justify this connection.
For example, the cluster property holds in $\spr$ even though shortest paths are $\np$-hard to compute.

\summary{Paper summary in light of motivation: We've discovered the first efficiently computable distance, given by a parameter range in known tree spaces, and want to understand the reason for the complexity jump -- cite ``Beyond worst-case complexity.''}
In this paper, we establish that for a certain tree rearrangement operation (a generalisation of $\nni$) the complexity of computing shortest paths is $\O(n^2)$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}).
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first tree rearrangement operation with polynomial-time computable shortest paths and distances between trees.
Our algorithm is practical as it allows to compute distances between trees with hundreds of thousands of leaves, while in the closely related $\nni$ graph this number is well smaller than 20 \autocite{todo}.
To prove the main result of this paper, Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}, we will show that the algorithm $\findpath$ of \textcite{Collienne2019-ca} computes shortest paths in the ranked nearest neighbour interchange graph ($\rnni$) in polynomial time.
We will also prove that the $\rnni$ graph has the cluster property, which, as discussed, is an important property distinguishing this graph from the $\nni$ graph.
We then generalise the $\findpath$ algorithm to trees with arbitrary integer-valued branch lengths and show that computing distances between such trees is also polynomial time.
We will finish this paper by asking and studying the question of characterising the (numeric) parameter that is responsible for the complexity shift from $\np$-hard to polynomial.
Specifically, we introduce a parameter $\rho$ that weighs edges in the $\rnni$ graph and consider the parametrised graph $\nni(\rho)$.
We show that $\rnni(0)$ has the same complexity of computing distances as the $\nni$ graph, while in $\rnni(1)$ the problem is solvable in $\O(n^2)$.
Hence changing $\rho$ from zero to one shifts the complexity from $\np$-hard to polynomial.
We leave it as an open problem to characterise the values of $\rho \in [0,1]$ for which the complexity of computing distances in the parametrised graph is polynomial.
We will provide some insights into this problem at the end of this paper.


\section{Definitions and background results}

\summary{Defining ranked trees and clusters.}
Unless stated otherwise, in this paper we work with \emph{ranked phylogenetic trees}, which we simply call \emph{trees}, that are binary trees where leaves are uniquely labelled by elements of the set $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ for a fixed integer $n$, and all internal (non-leaf) nodes are uniquely \emph{ranked} by the elements of the set $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ so that children have strictly smaller ranks than their parents.
All leaves are assumed to have rank $0$.
Two trees are considered to be identical if there exists an isomorphism between them which preserves edges, leaf labels, and node rankings.
For example, trees in Figure~\ref{fig:ranked_trees_ex} are all different.
In total there are $\frac{(n - 1)! n!}{2^{n-1}}$ such trees on $n$ leaves \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ranked_trees_ex}
\caption{Trees in the $\rnni$ graph with three $\nni$ moves on the left and a rank move on the right.}
\label{fig:ranked_trees_ex}
\end{figure}

Because internal nodes of a tree $T$ are ranked uniquely, we can address to \textbf{the} node of rank $t \in \{1, \ldots, n - 1\}$, and we write $(T)_t$ to denote this node.
An \emph{interval} $[(T)_t,(T)_{t+1}]$ is defined by two nodes of consecutive ranks.
A \emph{cluster} $C$ in a tree $T$ is a subsets of leaves $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ that contains all leaves descending from an internal node of $T$.
We then say that this internal node \emph{induces} the cluster $C$, and that the subtree rooted at this node is \emph{induced} by $C$.
Trees can uniquely be specified using the \emph{cluster representation}, that is a list of all clusters induced by internal nodes of that tree ordered according to the ranks of internal nodes.
For example, the cluster representation of tree $T$ in Figure~\ref{fig:ranked_trees_ex} is $[\{a_1, a_2\}, \{a_1, a_2, a_3\}, \{a_4, a_5\}]$.
For a set $S \subseteq \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ and tree $T$, we denote the \emph{most recent common ancestor} of $S$ in $T$, that is the node of the lowest rank in $T$ that induces a cluster containing all elements of $S$, by $(S)_T$.
Note that $(C)_T = (T)_t$ if the cluster $C$ is induced by the node of rank $t$ in $T$.

\summary{Defining graph $\rnni(\rho)$.}
We are now ready to introduce the main object of study in this paper, a graph $\rnni(\rho)$ on trees, for $\rho \geq 0$.
The vertices of the $\rnni(\rho)$ graph are trees as introduced above.
Two trees are connected by an edge if one results from the other by performing one of the following two tree rearrangement operations:
A \emph{rank move} on a tree $T$ exchanges the ranks of two internal nodes $(T)_t$ and $(T)_{t+1}$ with rank difference one for $0 < t < n-1$.
Ranked trees $T$ and $R$ are connected by an \emph{$\nni$ move} if there are edges $e$ in $T$ and $f$ in $R$ of length one such that the trees resulting from shrinking $e$ and $f$ to internal nodes gives two isomorphic (non-binary) trees.
To parameterise the $\rnni$ graph with parameter $\rho$, edges are weighted by either one or $\rho \in [0, \infty)$, depending on whether they represent $\nni$ or rank moves, respectively.
\todo{LC: We could mention the connection of $\rnni(0)$ and $\nni$ here and explain it in further detail later (maybe even at the very end of the paper?)}
It follows that $\rnni(1)$ if the $\rnni$ graph while $\rnni(0)$ represents the $\nni$ graph.

\summary{Introduce decision problem} $\rnni(\rho)$ \summary{and explain how its complexity depends on} $\rho$.
In this paper we focus on the following decision problem:

\todo{Is it OK to use the same name for the graph and the decision problem?}
\begin{decision_problem}[$\rnni(\rho)$]
Given $\rho \in [0,\infty)$, integers $k > 0$, and two trees $T$ and $R$.

Is the distance between $T$ and $R$ in $G_\rho$ less or equal to $k$?
\label{problem:rnni_dist}
\end{decision_problem}

\summary{Introducing} $\findpath$.
For proving that $\rnni$ can be solved in polynomial time we now present the algorithm $\findpath$, which has been introduced in \autocite{Collienne2019-ca}.
This algorithm computes paths between two trees $T$ and $R = [C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}]$, and we will see in Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial} that these paths are actually shortest paths.
$\findpath$ considers the clusters $C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}$ of $R$ in this order to compute a path $p$ from $T$ to $R$.
During each iteration $i = 1, \ldots, n-2$ trees can be added to $p$, possibly none or just one, we will always refer to the last tree of $p$ as $T'$.
In iteration $i$ the rank of $(C_{i})_{T'}$ is decreased by $\rnni$ moves until $C_i$ is induced by the node of rank $i$ in $T'$ on $p$.
As discussed in \autocite{Collienne2019-ca}, $\findpath$ is a deterministic algorithm with running tome quadratic in the number of leaves $n$.
Specifically, there is always a unique move that decreases the rank of $(C_{i})_{T'}$ as described above.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{$\findpath$($T,R$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $T' := T$, $p := [T']$, $[C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}] := R$
\FOR {$k = 1, \dots, n-2$}
\label{alg:findpath:line:for_loop}
	\WHILE {$\rank((C_k)_{T'})>k$}
		\IF {$(C_k)_{T'}$ and node $u$ with rank $\rank((C_k)_{T'})-1$ are connected by an edge}
			\STATE $T''$ is $T'$ with $(C_k)_{T'}$ decreased by an $\nni$ move
		\ELSE
			\STATE $T''$ is $T'$ with ranks of nodes $u$ and $(C_k)_{T'}$ swapped
		\ENDIF
		\label{alg:findpath:line:move_set_down}
		\STATE $T' = T''$
		\STATE $p = p+T'$
	\ENDWHILE
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $p$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Things to introduce:

\begin{itemize}
\item if needed for generalisation: edge vs rank intervals, (ultrametric) discrete time-trees, (ranked and unranked) tree topologies
\item We can always talk about ranked phylogenetic trees (and call them trees throughout the paper) but then say that the rank move can be ignored (leading to an NP-hard problem) or counted as one move (quadratic)
\item $\findpath$, including its extension to discrete time-trees
\end{itemize}


\section{Complexity of computing $\rnni$ distances}

\summary{A few words about the main theorem and its proof.}
The following theorem, that $\rnni \in \p$, is the main result of our paper.
The proof of the theorem reduces the problem to establishing a local property (see~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) below) about the $\findpath$ algorithm -- $\findpath$ always chooses the best tree possible to go to.
Importantly, this result can be used for an arbitrary vertex proposal algorithm in an arbitrary graph to establish that the algorithms computes a shortest path between vertices in the graph, hence our proof technique is of general interest.

\begin{theorem}
The time complexity of computing the $\rnni$ distance between trees on $n$ leaves is $\O(n^2)$.
\label{thm:rnni_polynomial}
\end{theorem}

\proof
We prove this theorem by showing that for every pair of trees $T$ and $R$, the path computed by the $\findpath$ algorithm is a shortest $\rnni$ path.
We denote this path by $\fp(T, R)$ and its length by $|\fp(T, R)|$.

Assume to the contrary that $T$ and $R$ are two trees with a minimum possible distance $d(T, R)$ such that $d(T,R) \neq |\fp(T,R)|$, that is, $d(T,R) < |\fp(T,R)|$.
Let $T'$ be the first tree on a shortest $\rnni$ path from $T$ to $R$.
Then $d(T',R) = d(T, R) - 1$ and the distance between $T'$ and $R$ is strictly smaller than that between $T$ and $R$.
Hence $d(T', R) = |\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.
We finish the proof by showing that no trees satisfy this inequality.

Specifically, we will show that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mbox{for all trees $T$, $R$, and $T'$}	& \mbox{ such that $T'$ is one $\rnni$ move away from $T$,}\\
					&|\fp(T',R)| \geq |\fp(T,R)| - 1
\end{split}
 \label{eqn:iff_inequality}
\end{equation}

We will use Figure~\ref{fig:proof_idea} to demonstrate our argument.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{proof_idea_ag}
\caption{Trees $T$, $T'$, and $R$ as in inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).
Paths $\fp(T,R) = [T,T_1,T_2, \ldots, R]$ and $\fp(T',R) = [T',T'_1,T'_2, \ldots, R]$ are indicated by arrows.}
\label{fig:proof_idea}
\end{figure}

Assume to the contrary that $T$ and $R$ are trees for which there exists $T'$ violating inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).
Out of all such pairs $T, R$ choose one with the minimal $|\fp(T, R)|$.
Denote $\fp(T,R) = [T, T_1, T_2, \ldots, R]$ and $\fp(T', R) = [T', T_1', T_2', \ldots, R]$, and let $[(T)_t, (T)_{t+1}]$ be the interval in $T$ on which the $\rnni$ move connecting $T$ and $T'$ is performed.
Let $C_k$ be the cluster of $R$ such that the node $(C_k)_T$ is moved down by the first move on $\fp(T, R)$.
If the rank of $(C_k)_T$ is not in $\{t, t+1\}$ then $(C_k)_T$ and $(C_k)_{T'}$ induce the same cluster, so $\findpath$ would make the same rearrangement in both trees $T$ and $T'$ in the first move along $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ resulting in trees $T_1$ and $T_1'$ which are $\rnni$ neighbours, as in Figure~\ref{fig:proof_idea}.
In this case, paths $\fp(T_1, R)$ and $\fp(T_1', R)$ violate inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) but $\fp(T_1, R)$ is strictly shorter than $\fp(T, R)$, contradicting our minimality assumption.
Hence, the first move on $\fp(T, R)$ has to involve an interval incident to at least one of the nodes $(T)_t$, $(T)_{t+1}$.

We will distinguish two cases depending on whether $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ or a rank move.
For each of these we will further distinguish all possible moves between $T$ and $T_1$.
Note that in all figures illustrating possible moves on $\fp(T,R)$ and $\fp(T',R)$, the positions of tree roots are irrelevant, so we have positioned the roots to simplify our figures.

\textbf{Case 1.}
$T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move, so $((T)_t,(T)_{t+1})$ is an edge in $T$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni1}.
Denote the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_t$ by $A$ and $B$ and the cluster induced by the child of $(T)_{t+1}$ that is not $(T)_t$ by $C$, and assume that the $\nni$ move between $T$ and $T'$ exchanges the subtrees induced by clusters $B$ and $C$.
Additionally, denote the cluster induced by the child of $(T)_{t+2}$ that is not $(T)_{t+1}$ by $D$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{thm_fp_nni1}
\caption{$\nni$ move between $T$ and $T'$ on the bold edge $((T)_t,(T)_{t+1})$ and the third $\rnni$ neighbour resulting from a move on that edge.}
\label{fig:thm_fp_nni1}
\end{figure}

We now consider all possible moves $\findpath$ can perform to go from $T$ to $T_1$ that involve a node of rank $t$ or $t+1$, that is, we will consider three intervals in total.

\begin{enumerate}[label = 1.{\arabic*}]
\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_t, (T)_{t+1}]$.
Note that this move has to be the $\nni$ move that is different from the $\nni$ move connecting $T$ and $T'$.

In this case, the cluster $B \cup C$ is built in $T_1$, as depicted in the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni1}.
It follows that the cluster $C_k$ that is considered first by $\findpath$ must contain elements from both $B$ and $C$.
But then $\findpath$ applied to $T'$ and $R$ has to decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ in its first step implying that $T'_1 = T_1$, so $|\fp(T',R)| = |\fp(T,R)|$.
This contradicts our assumption that $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$ that swaps the subtrees induced by clusters $C$ and $D$.
This move is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} by an arrow from $T$ to the leftmost tree in the middle row.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Comparison of paths $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ if $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move on edge $((T)_{t+1},T_{t+2})$ in $T$.
	The bottom row displays all possibilities for $T_2$ and $T'_2$, depending on the position of cluster $C_k$ that is considered by $\findpath$:
	${C_k \subseteq B \cup D}$ is on the left, ${C_k \subseteq A \cup D}$ is in the middle, ${C_k \subseteq C \cup D}$ is on the right.}
	\label{fig:thm_fp_nni}
\end{figure}

Note that the cluster $C_k$ that is considered by $\findpath$ in the first step of computing $\fp(T, R)$ must intersect $D$.
Additionally, $C_k$ must intersect $A$, or $B$, or both of them.
Hence, we will consider each of these three cases individually.

We will use Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni} to demonstrate all the three cases below.

\begin{enumerate}[label = \theenumi.\arabic*]
\item $C_k$ intersects each of $A$, $B$, and $D$.
We can assume $k > 1$ and $C_{k-1} = (R)_{k-1}$ as $C_1$ contains two elements and can therefore only intersect with either $A$ or $B$.
Since $C_k$ is the first cluster considered by $\findpath$, the two clusters that make up $C_k$ in $R$ must be present in $T$.
So $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$.
Since $A \cup B$ is not a cluster in $T'$, $\findpath$ will decrease the rank of $(C_{k-1})_{T'}$ on $\fp(T', R)$ before considering cluster $C_k$.
Note that the clusters induced by nodes of rank $i < k - 1$ in $T$ and $T'$ coincide, so all moves, if any, on $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ that involve those cluster will be the same.
The $\rnni$ move decreases the rank of $(C_{k-1})_{T'}$ by building cluster $A \cup B$, in which case $T'_1 = T$.
This however contradicts $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

\item $C_k \subseteq A \cup D$.
\label{deep_case_details}
Starting from $T$, $\findpath$ exchanges first subtrees induced by clusters $C$ and $D$ and then by $B$ and $D$.
This results in trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ -- see the path leading to the tree in the middle of the bottom row in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.
Starting from $T'$, $\findpath$ exchanges first subtrees induced by $B$ and $D$ and then by $C$ and $D$.
This results in trees $T_1'$ and $T_2'$ -- see the path leading to the tree in the middle of the bottom row in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}.
It follows that $T_2$ and $T'_2$ only differ by one interval (indicated by dotted edges in the corresponding trees in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni}), and hence they are $\rnni$ neighbours.
This together with the facts that $|\fp(T_2,R)| = |\fp(T,R)|-2$ and $|\fp(T'_2,R)| = |\fp(T',R)|-2$ contradicts the assumption that $|\fp(T,R)|$ is a minimal length violating inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).

\item $C_k \subseteq B \cup D$.
This case is analogous to the previous one.
The two initial segments of $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ are the paths leading to the leftmost trees in the bottom row of Figures~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} and \ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}, respectively.
Note that the rank swap leading from $T_1'$ to $T_2'$ is required because the rank of $(C_k)_R$ is at most $t$ as implied by the move leading from $T_1$ to $T_2$.
The corresponding trees $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are again $\rnni$ neighbours.
\end{enumerate}

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$ that builds a cluster $C \cup D$ in $T_1$.
\label{case:one_or_two_moves_down}
This move is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} by an arrow from $T$ to the second leftmost tree in the middle row.
In this case, $C_k \subseteq C \cup D$.

If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$ is a cluster in $R$.
Since $A \cup B$ is not a cluster in $T'$, the first $\rnni$ move on $\fp(T', R)$ builds the cluster $A \cup B$ by swapping subtrees induced by cluster $B$ and $C$.
This move results in $T_1' = T$ contradicting $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
This results in the path from $T$ to the rightmost tree in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.
Hence, $\fp(T', R)$ also has to begin with two moves that decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ twice, resulting in the rightmost path in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}.
Similarly to case~\ref{deep_case_details}, we arrive at a contradiction that trees $T_2$, $T_2'$, and $R$ violate inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) and $|\fp(T_2,R)| < |\fp(T,R)|$.

\item Rank move on interval $[(T)_{t+1},(T)_{t+2}]$.
\label{case:rank_move_interval_above}
This case is analogous to case~\ref{case:one_or_two_moves_down}.
If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$ is a cluster in $R$, and applying $\findpath$ to $T', R$ we get $T'_1 = T$.
If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
Recall that the interval between nodes of rank $t$ and $t+1$ is an edge in both $T$ and $T'$.
Hence, the first two moves on $\fp(T', R)$ decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ twice resulting in $T'_2$ which is an $\rnni$ neighbour of $T_2$.
As before, this contradicts our minimality assumption.

\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_{t-1},(T)_t]$.
In this case $C_k \subseteq A \cup B$, so the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ by exchanging the subtrees induced by $B$ and $C$.
This results in $T'_1 = T$.
This argument applies whether or not $((T)_{t-1},(T)_t)$ is an edge in $T$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Case 2.}
$T$ and $T'$ are connected by a rank move on the interval between nodes of rank $t$ and $t+1$.
Denote the cluster induced by $(T)_t$ by $A$, the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_t$ by $A_1$ and $A_2$, the cluster induced by $(T)_{t+1}$ by $B$, and the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_{t+1}$ by $B_1$ and $B_2$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.

\begin{figure}[!hbt]

\label{fig:thm_fp_rank1}
\end{figure}

We again consider all possible moves $\findpath$ can perform to go from $T$ to $T_1$ that involve a node of rank $t$ or $t+1$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = 2.\arabic*]
\item Rank move on $[(T)_t,(T)_{t+1}]$.
This move results in $T_1 = T'$.

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1},(T)_{t+2}]$.
The following two sub-cases are analogous to case~\ref{case:one_or_two_moves_down}.

\begin{enumerate}[label = \theenumi.\arabic*]
	\item $(T)_{t+2}$ is a parent of $(T)_t$.
	The first move on $\fp(T, R)$ builds a cluster $A \cup B_1$ or $A \cup B_2$, and we assume without loss of generality that it is the former, as in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	This implies that $C_k \subseteq A \cup B_1$.
	If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A$ is a cluster in $R$.
	Therefore, the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ decreases the rank of $(A)_{T'}$, which results in $T_1' = T$.
	If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
	Due to the symmetry we can assume that $C_k \subseteq A_1 \cup B_1$, which implies that the move between $T_1$ to $T_2$ exchanges the subtrees induced by $A_2$ and $B_1$, as depicted on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	$C_k \subseteq A_1 \cup B_1$ implies that the first two moves on $\fp(T', R)$ result in a tree $T'_2$ that is an $\rnni$ neighbour of $T_2$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	This is a contradiction to the minimality assumption on $|\fp(T,R)|$.

	\item $(T)_{t+2}$ is not a parent of $(T)_t$.
	In this case, there exists a cluster $C$ induced by the child of $(T)_{t+2}$ which is different from the one that induces $B$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{thm_fp_rank2}
	\caption{Comparison of paths $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ if there is a rank move between $T$ and $T'$ and an $\nni$ move on the edge below the corresponding (rank) interval follows on $\fp(T, R)$.}
	\label{fig:thm_fp_rank2}
\end{figure}
	We can assume without loss of generality that $C_k \subseteq C \cup B_1$ and the first move on $\fp(T, R)$ builds a new cluster $C \cup B_1$.
	If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A$ is a cluster in $R$, which implies that $A$ is induced by the node of rank $t$ in both $T$ and $R$.
	So $T'_1 = T$.
	If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}.
	The corresponding first moves on $\fp(T', R)$ are shown on the right in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}, and we again get that $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are $\rnni$ neighbours.
\end{enumerate}

\item Rank move on interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$.
Again, depending on whether or not the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide, we arrive at the conclusion that either $T_1' = T$ or $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are $\rnni$ neighbours, similar to case~\ref{case:rank_move_interval_above}.

\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_{t-1},(T)_t]$.
In this case $C_k \subseteq A$ and the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ must be a rank swap resulting in $T_1' = T$.
\end{enumerate}

Since all possible cases result in a contradiction, we conclude that inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) is true for all trees, which completes the proof of the theorem.
\endproof

\summary{Proving the Cluster Property for $\rnni$}

\begin{corollary}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be two trees sharing a cluster $C$ and $p$ a shortest path from $T$ to $R$ in $\rnni$.
	Then every tree on $p$ contains the cluster $C$.
	\label{cluster_thm}
\end{corollary}

\proof
	Assume to the contrary that $T$, $R$, $C$, and $p$ is a courter-example to the statement.
	We can assume that no counterexample exists for paths shorter than $p$, so the first tree $T'$ after $T$ on $p$ does not contain the cluster $C$.
	Therefore $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move that moves a subtrees rooted at a child of $(C)_T$ out of the subtree induced by $C$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_thm_proof}, where by $C_1$, $C_2$ we denote the clusters induced by the children of $(C)_T$.
	Note that the only clusters in $T$ that distinguish $T$ from $T'$ are $C$ and the cluster induced by the node right above $(C)_{T}$, which is of the same rank as $(C)_{T'}$.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{cluster_thm_proof}

	Dashed lines indicate identical trees.}
	\label{fig:cluster_thm_proof}
	\end{figure}

	Since $T$ and $R$ have the minimum possible distance among all counterexamples to the theorem, we can assume, using the same argument as in the beginning of the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}, that $C$ is the first cluster considered by $\findpath$ on $\fp(T, R)$.
	But in this case, the first move on $\fp(T',R)$ builds the cluster $C$ and results in tree $T$, which is a contradiction.
\endproof


\section{Generalisation to discrete time-trees}

\summary{Generalising} $\findpath$ \summary{for discrete time-trees}
We now consider the obvious extension of $\findpath$ to discrete time-trees.

\begin{corollary}
	$\findpath$ computes shortest paths between discrete time-trees.
\end{corollary}

\proof
	Let $T$ and $R$ be discrete time-trees and let $m$ be the maximum of the times assigned to the roots of $T$ and $R$.
	We construct trees $T'$ and $R'$ in $\rnni$ on $m + 1$ leaves by adding $m + 1 - n$ new leaves in the following way.
	Add a new root with rank $m+1$ to tree $T$, such that $T$ is a subtree rooted in one of the children of this new node.
	The other child of this new root is a caterpillar tree with leaf labels in $\{n+1, \ldots, m+1\}$ such that the ranks of the parents of these leaves are ordered according to the leaf labels and the resulting tree does not contain intervals of length greater than one.
	The same way we obtain tree $R'$ from $R$.

	We can convert a path $p$ from $T$ to $R$ to a path $p'$ from $T'$ to $R'$ so that $|p| = |p'|$ by exchanging all length moves on $p$ to rank swaps on $p'$.
	All rank moves and $\nni$ moves on $p'$ remain the same as on $p'$.
	By the construction of $T'$ and $R'$ it follows that $p'$ ends in $R'$, as the additional caterpillar subtree does not change.
	As every move on $p$ corresponds to exactly one move on $p'$, the lengths of these paths coincide.

	$\fp(T,R)$ is defined by transforming the moves along $\fp(T',R')$ in the similar way.
	To show that $\fp(T, R)$ computes a shortest path, we observe that if there was another path $p$ from $T$ to $R$ strictly shorter than $\fp(T, R)$, we can construct a path $p'$ with $|p'| = |p| < |\fp(T,R)| = |\fp(T',R')s|$ between $T'$ and $R'$ as explained above, which is a contradiction to Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}.
\endproof

\summary{Why the complexity of $\rnni(\rho)$ might be different from $\nni$ or $\rnni$ for $\rho$ big enough.}


\section{Conclusion}

\todo{LC: Shall the following discussion stay as conclusion? We definitely need to mention here how cool it is to have a polynomial tree space}
\summary{Everything we know so far about the complexity of} $\rnni(\rho)$ \summary{-- $\rnni(1) \in \p$ and $\rnni(0) \in \np$}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial} we know that distances in $\rnni(1)$ can be computed in polynomial time, as this is the $\rnni$ graph.
The computation of distances in $\rnni(0)$ however is $\np$-hard, as we can follow from the following observation.

\begin{lemma}
Let $p = [T_1, \ldots, T_m]$ be a path in $\rnni(0)$.
Then the path $p'$ which results from $p$ by ignoring all rankings in the trees on $p$ and deleting duplicated trees is a path in $\nni$ such that the lengths of $p$ and $p'$ are equal, where the length of $p$ is defined as the sum of edge weights of edges $(T_i,T_{i+1})$ in $\rnni(0)$ for all $i = 1, \ldots, m-1$.
\end{lemma}

\proof
The only moves on $p$ with weight greater than zero are $\nni$ moves.
Therefore the length of $p$ equals the number of $\nni$ moves on this path.
And as transforming $p$ into $p'$ as described above deletes all rank moves and none of the $\nni$ moves, the lengths of $p$ and $p'$ coincide.
\endproof

This result implies in particular that shortest paths in $\rnni(0)$ give shortest paths in $\nni$.
Since \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa} proved that computing distances in $\nni$ is $\np$-hard we can conclude the same for $\rnni(0)$.
We can conclude that the complexity of computing the ranked nearest neighbour interchange distance between trees depends on the weight of rank rearrangements and can change from quadratic, when rank moves are counted as one rearrangement, to NP-hard, when rank moves are ignored.
It hence is natural to ask whether a boundary exists at which the problem switches from polynomial to hard.

\begin{question}
Is there a threshold $r \in [0,1]$ for which $\rnni(\rho) \in \np$ for all $\rho \leq r$, and $\rnni(\rho) \in \p$ for all $\rho > r$?
\end{question}

\summary{Rank moves and $\nni$ moves can appear in different proportions on shortest paths and this is related to $\fp$ not computing shortest paths if $\rho \neq 1$}
When considering the problem of characterising the complexity of computing the distance in $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho \neq 0,1$, an important question is how to balance the trade off between $\nni$ and rank moves.
Indeed, examples exist when different shortest paths between trees have different number of $\nni$ moves, that is, some $\nni$ moves can be traded for rank moves.
The following observation, which follows from the existence of such different shortest paths, provides a first step towards understanding of this trade off using the $\findpath$ algorithm.

\begin{lemma}
	$\findpath$ computes shortest paths only for $\rnni(1)$, and not for other $\rnni(\rho)$ with $\rho \neq 1$.
\end{lemma}


In what follows we consider this question in more detail and leave its complete solution as an open problem.
