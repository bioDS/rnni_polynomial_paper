\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
Many popular algorithms for searching the space of leaf-labelled (phylogenetic) trees are based on tree rearrangement operations.
Under any such operation, the problem is reduced to searching a graph where vertices are trees and (undirected) edges are given by pairs of trees connected by one rearrangement operation (sometimes called a move).
Most popular are the classical nearest neighbour interchange, subtree prune and regraft, and tree bisection and reconnection moves.
The shortest path problem, however, is $\np$-hard in each of these graphs, making tree inference and comparison algorithms challenging to design in practice.

Although ranked phylogenetic trees are one of the central objects of interest in applications, the computational complexity of the shortest path problem for these trees remained unsolved for decades.
In this paper, we settle this problem for the ranked nearest neighbour interchange operation by establishing that the complexity depends on the weight difference between two types of tree rearrangement operations (rank moves and edge moves) in this graph, and varies from quadratic to $\np$-hard.
In particular, our result provides the first example of a phylogenetic tree rearrangement operation for which shortest paths, and hence the distance, can be computed efficiently.
Specifically, our algorithm scales to trees with thousands of leaves.

We also propose a study of the parameter for weight difference between move types, that changes the complexity of the shortest path problem in our graph from quadratic to $\np$-hard.
In this paper we will provide an insight into this approach, motivated by ideas developed in the beyond worst-case analysis framework.

\summary{Motivation: many popular tree search algorithms are based on NNI (e.g. this \url{https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/28/10/2731/973375} tool has been cited 40K+ times, see also references there to PhyML, RaxML, etc. -- they all use NNI); other applications include tree comparison methods, tree inference methods (proposal distributions), summary statistics, etc.}
The problem of reconstructing evolutionary histories given sequence data is central for many tree inference methods used in computational evolutionary biology.
Some of the most popular methods infer trees from sequences via maximum likelihood \autocite{Stamatakis2006-xb, Guindon2010-lo}, MCMC \autocite{Ronquist2003-eq, Suchard2018-tw, Bouckaert2019-yr}, distance-, or parsimony-based approaches \autocite{Tamura2011-ky}.
All these methods rely of various tree rearrangement operations \autocite{Semple2003-nj}, the most popular of which are nearest neighbour interchange ($\nni$), subtree prune and regraft ($\spr$), and tree bisection and reconnection ($\tbr$).
The tree inference problem hence can be formulated as a graph search, where vertices are trees and edges are given by the tree rearrangement operation of interest.

\summary{Motivation: However, all known graph-based tree rearrangement distances, including NNI, are NP-hard, and it took many years and paper to prove that; so approach such as practical FPT algorithms is an active area of research to overcome the computational (cite Whidden).}
Classical results in mathematical phylogenetics imply that computing rearrangement distances between trees, that is, the minimum number of tree rearrangements necessary to convert one tree into another, is $\np$-hard \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa, Bordewich2005-nx, Hickey2008-wv, Allen2001-ky} for all three rearrangement operations $\nni$, $\spr$, and $\tbr$.
We will formally introduce all necessary definitions later in the paper.
Intuitively, the difference between the three operations is how much change can be done to a tree by a single operation, with $\nni$ being the most local type of rearrangement and $\tbr$ the most global one.
Remarkably, it took over 25 years and a number of published erroneous attempts, as discussed in detail by \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa}, to prove that the shortest path problem is $\np$-hard in $\nni$ \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.
Similarly for $\spr$, before \textcite{Bordewich2005-nx} proved the $\np$-hardness result for rooted trees and \textcite{Hickey2008-wv} utilised this proof to establish the result for unrooted trees, incorrect proofs have been discussed in the literature \autocite{Hein1996-em, Allen2001-ky}.
To facilitate practical applications, several fixed parameter tractable algorithms for computing the $\spr$ distance have been developed over the years \autocite{Whidden2010-bw, Bordewich2005-nx, Whidden2018-fw}.
Although these algorithm advanced the applicability of the methods significantly, they remain impractical for large distances and are only applied to trees with a moderate number of leaves or those with small distances.
It is still unknown whether the fixed parameter tractability result holds in $\nni$, so the algorithms for computing shortest paths in $\nni$ remain largely impractical.
This is an active area of research in modern computational phylogenetics \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.

\summary{Historically, the complexity question was following hand in hand with the cluster property -- more history plus biological relevance of the property.}
The idea utilised by \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa} to prove that the shortest path problem in $\nni$ is $\np$-hard stems from a result that shortest paths in $\nni$ do not preserve clusters \autocite{Li1996-zw}, that is, two trees sharing a cluster does not imply that all trees along a shortest path have that cluster.
We will say that $\nni$ does not have the cluster property (see below for a formal description).
Not only this counter-intuitive property eventually led to the computational hardness result, the property made little sense biologically as trees clustering the same set of sequences into a subtree should be closer to each other than to a tree that does not have that subtree.
Indeed, a shared cluster means that both trees support the hypothesis that this cluster has evolved along a subtree.
It was believed that the cluster property and the computational complexity of the shortest path problem were related \autocite{Li1996-zw}, so the two questions have historically been studied simultaneously \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.
However, there is little evidence to justify this connection.
For example, the cluster property holds in $\spr$ even though the shortest path problem is $\np$-hard there.

\summary{Paper summary in light of motivation: We've discovered the first efficiently computable distance, given by a parameter range in known tree spaces, and want to understand the reason for the complexity jump -- cite ``Beyond worst-case complexity.''}
In this paper, we establish that for a certain tree rearrangement operation (a generalisation of $\nni$) the complexity of the shortest path problem is $\O(n^2)$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}).
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first tree rearrangement operation with polynomial-time computable shortest paths and distances between trees.
Our algorithm is practical as it allows to compute distances between trees with thousands of leaves, while in the closely related $\nni$ graph this number is well smaller \autocite{Whidden2016-kl} than 20.
To prove the main result of this paper, Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}, we will show that the algorithm $\findpath$ of \textcite{Collienne2019-ca} computes shortest paths in the ranked nearest neighbour interchange graph ($\rnni$) in polynomial time.
We will also prove that the $\rnni$ graph has the cluster property, which, as discussed, is an important property distinguishing this graph from the $\nni$ graph.
We then generalise the $\findpath$ algorithm to trees with arbitrary integer-valued branch lengths and show that the shortest path problem for such trees is also polynomial time.
We will finish this paper by asking and studying the question of characterising the (numeric) parameter that is responsible for the complexity shift from $\np$-hard to polynomial.
Specifically, we introduce a parameter $\rho$ that weighs edges in the $\rnni$ graph and consider the parametrised graph $\rnni(\rho)$.
We show that the shortest path problem in $\rnni(0)$ has the same complexity as in the $\nni$ graph, while in $\rnni(1)$ the problem is solvable in $\O(n^2)$.
Hence changing $\rho$ from zero to one shifts the complexity from $\np$-hard to polynomial.

We propose it as an open problem to characterise the values of $\rho \in [0,1]$ for which the complexity of computing distances in the parametrised graph is polynomial.
The problem is similar in spirit to the ``beyond worst-case analysis'' \autocite{Roughgarden2019-to} because we have identified a parameter responsible for the shift of complexity from practically impossible to highly efficient, we hence hope that the approaches reviewed by \textcite{Roughgarden2019-to} will be helpful for this study.
We will provide some insights into this problem at the end of this paper.


\section{Definitions and background results}

\summary{Defining ranked trees and clusters.}
Unless stated otherwise, in this paper we work with \emph{ranked phylogenetic trees}, which we simply call \emph{trees}, that are binary trees where leaves are uniquely labelled by elements of the set $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ for a fixed integer $n$, and all internal (non-leaf) nodes are uniquely \emph{ranked} by elements of the set $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ so that children have strictly smaller ranks than their parents.
All leaves are assumed to have rank $0$.
Two trees are considered to be identical if there exists an isomorphism between them which preserves edges, leaf labels, and node rankings.
For example, trees in Figure~\ref{fig:ranked_trees_ex} are all different.
In total there are $\frac{(n - 1)! n!}{2^{n-1}}$ such trees on $n$ leaves \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ranked_trees_ex}
\caption{Trees in the $\rnni$ graph with three $\nni$ moves on the left and a rank move on the right.}
\label{fig:ranked_trees_ex}
\end{figure}

Because internal nodes of a tree $T$ are ranked uniquely, we can address \textbf{the} node of rank $t \in \{1, \ldots, n - 1\}$, and we write $(T)_t$ to denote this node.
An \emph{interval} $[(T)_t,(T)_{t+1}]$ is defined by two nodes of consecutive ranks.
A \emph{cluster} $C \subseteq \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ in a tree $T$ is a subsets of leaves that contains all leaves descending from an internal node of $T$.
We then say that this internal node \emph{induces} the cluster $C$, and that the subtree rooted at this node is \emph{induced} by $C$.
Trees can uniquely be specified using the \emph{cluster representation}, that is a list of all clusters induced by internal nodes of that tree ordered according to the ranks of internal nodes.
For example, the cluster representation of tree $T$ in Figure~\ref{fig:ranked_trees_ex} is $[\{a_1, a_2\}, \{a_1, a_2, a_3\}, \{a_4, a_5\}]$.
For a set $S \subseteq \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ and tree $T$, we denote the \emph{most recent common ancestor} of $S$ in $T$, that is the node of the lowest rank in $T$ that induces a cluster containing all elements of $S$, by $(S)_T$.
Note that $(C)_T = (T)_t$ if the cluster $C$ is induced by the node of rank $t$ in $T$.

\summary{Defining graph $\rnni(\rho)$.}
We are now ready to introduce the main object of study in this paper, the graph $\rnni(\rho)$ on trees, for $\rho \geq 0$.
The vertices of the $\rnni(\rho)$ graph are trees as introduced above.
Two trees are connected by an edge if one results from the other by performing one of the following two tree rearrangement operations:
(i) A \emph{rank move} on a tree $T$ exchanges the ranks of two internal nodes $(T)_t$ and $(T)_{t+1}$ with consecutive ranks, provided the two nodes are not connected by an edge in the tree $T$.
(ii) Trees $T$ and $R$ are connected by an \emph{$\nni$ move} if there are edges $e$ in $T$ and $f$ in $R$ both connecting nodes of consecutive ranks in the corresponding trees, such that the trees resulting from shrinking $e$ and $f$ to internal nodes gives two isomorphic (non-binary) trees.
Figure~\ref{fig:ranked_trees_ex} gives examples of these tree rearrangements.
The parameter $\rho \geq 0$ is the weight of the rank move operation, the $\nni$ moves weigh one.
The \emph{weight of a path} is the sum of the weights of all moves along the path.
The \emph{distance} between two trees in $\rnni(\rho)$ is the weight of a path with the minimal weight.
In the main part of the paper we will concentrate on $\rho = 1$, so all edges in the graph will have equal weights and the graph can be assumed to be unweighted.

The main computational problem considered in this paper is the following shortest path problem

\medskip

\noindent $\decprob{\rho}$
\medskip\\
INSTANCE: A real number $\rho \geq 0$, an integer $k > 0$, and a pair of trees $T$ and $R$.\\
FIND: A path of minimal weight between $T$ and $R$ in $\rnni(\rho)$.

\medskip

Our first and main goal in this paper is to prove that $\decprob{1}$ is polynomial.
We will see later in the paper that it follows from a classical result \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa} that $\decprob{0}$ is $\np$-hard.
We will also study $\decprob{\rho}$ for other values of $\rho$ in this paper.
To be consistent with notations used in the literature \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol, Collienne2019-ca}, we will denote the graph $\rnni(1)$ by $\rnni$.


\section{Complexity of computing $\rnni$ distances}
\label{sec:rnni_complexity}

\summary{Introducing $\findpath$.}
In this section we will prove that the shortest path problem in $\rnni$ is decidable in polynomial time.
Our proof will be constructive -- we will show that the following quadratic algorithm of \textcite{Collienne2019-ca} called $\findpath$ computes a shortest path between two given trees in $\rnni$.
$\findpath$ algorithm receives two trees $T$ and $R$ in their cluster representation, and we denote the representation of $R$ by $[C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}]$.
The algorithm considers the clusters $C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}$ iteratively in their order and produces a sequence $p$ of trees which become a shortest path from $T$ to $R$ after the algorithm terminates.
During each iteration $k = 1, \ldots, n-2$ new trees are added to $p$ if necessary, and we will refer to the last added tree as $T'$.
In iteration $k$, the rank of $(C_{k})_{T'}$ is decreased by $\rnni$ moves until $C_k$ is induced by the node of rank $k$ in $T'$.
As we have shown \autocite{Collienne2019-ca}, $\findpath$ is a deterministic algorithm with running time quadratic in the number of leaves $n$.
In particular, there always exists a unique move that decreases the rank of $(C_{k})_{T'}$ as described above.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{$\findpath$($T,R$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $T' := T$, $p := [T']$, $[C_1, \ldots, C_{n-2}] := R$

	\WHILE {$\rank((C_k)_{T'})>k$}
		\IF {$(C_k)_{T'}$ and node $u$ with rank $\rank((C_k)_{T'})-1$ are connected by an edge}
			\STATE $T''$ is $T'$ with $(C_k)_{T'}$ decreased by an $\nni$ move
		\ELSE
			\STATE $T''$ is $T'$ with ranks of nodes $u$ and $(C_k)_{T'}$ swapped
		\ENDIF
		\label{alg:findpath:line:move_set_down}
		\STATE $T' = T''$
		\STATE $p = p+T'$
	\ENDWHILE
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $p$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\summary{A few words about the main theorem and its proof.}
The following theorem, that $\decprob{1}$ is polynomial, is the main result of our paper.
The proof of the theorem reduces the problem to establishing a local property (see~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) below) about the $\findpath$ algorithm.
The property can intuitively be understood as $\findpath$ always choosing the best tree possible to go to.
Importantly, this result can be used for an arbitrary vertex proposal algorithm in an arbitrary graph to establish that the algorithms computes a shortest path between vertices in the graph, hence our proof technique is of general interest.

We also note that due to the connection between ranked trees and lattices \autocite{Collienne2019-ca}, Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial} can be translated to the language of lattice theory.

\begin{theorem}
The time complexity the shortest path problem in the $\rnni$ graph on trees with $n$ leaves is $\O(n^2)$.
\label{thm:rnni_polynomial}
\end{theorem}

\proof
We prove this theorem by showing that for every pair of trees $T$ and $R$, the path computed by the $\findpath$ algorithm is a shortest $\rnni$ path.
We denote this path by $\fp(T, R)$ and its length by $|\fp(T, R)|$.

Assume to the contrary that $T$ and $R$ are two trees with a minimum distance $d(T, R)$ such that $d(T,R) \neq |\fp(T,R)|$, that is, $d(T,R) < |\fp(T,R)|$.
Let $T'$ be the first tree on a shortest $\rnni$ path from $T$ to $R$.
Then $d(T',R) = d(T, R) - 1$ and the distance between $T'$ and $R$ is strictly smaller than that between $T$ and $R$.
Hence $d(T', R) = |\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.
We finish the proof by showing that no trees satisfy this inequality.

Specifically, we will show that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mbox{for all trees $T$, $R$, and $T'$}	& \mbox{ such that $T'$ is one $\rnni$ move away from $T$,}\\
					&|\fp(T',R)| \geq |\fp(T,R)| - 1
\end{split}
 \label{eqn:iff_inequality}
\end{equation}

We will use Figure~\ref{fig:proof_idea} to demonstrate our argument.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{proof_idea_ag}
\caption{Trees $T$, $T'$, and $R$ as in inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).
Paths $\fp(T,R) = [T,T_1,T_2, \ldots, R]$ and $\fp(T',R) = [T',T'_1,T'_2, \ldots, R]$ are indicated by arrows.}
\label{fig:proof_idea}
\end{figure}

Assume to the contrary that $T$ and $R$ are trees for which there exists $T'$ violating inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).
Out of all such pairs $T, R$ choose one with the minimal $|\fp(T, R)|$.
Denote $\fp(T,R) = [T, T_1, T_2, \ldots, R]$ and $\fp(T', R) = [T', T_1', T_2', \ldots, R]$, and let $[(T)_t, (T)_{t+1}]$ be the interval in $T$ on which the $\rnni$ move connecting $T$ and $T'$ is performed.
Let $C_k$ be the cluster of $R$ such that the node $(C_k)_T$ is moved down by the first move on $\fp(T, R)$.
If the rank of $(C_k)_T$ is not in $\{t, t+1\}$ then $(C_k)_T$ and $(C_k)_{T'}$ induce the same cluster, so $\findpath$ would make the same rearrangement in both trees $T$ and $T'$ in the first move along $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ resulting in trees $T_1$ and $T_1'$ which are $\rnni$ neighbours, as in Figure~\ref{fig:proof_idea}.
In this case, paths $\fp(T_1, R)$ and $\fp(T_1', R)$ violate inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) but $\fp(T_1, R)$ is strictly shorter than $\fp(T, R)$, contradicting our minimality assumption.
Hence, the first move on $\fp(T, R)$ has to involve an interval incident to at least one of the nodes $(T)_t$, $(T)_{t+1}$.

We will distinguish two cases depending on whether $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ or a rank move.
For each of these we will further distinguish all possible moves between $T$ and $T_1$.
Note that in all figures illustrating possible moves on $\fp(T,R)$ and $\fp(T',R)$, the positions of tree roots are irrelevant, so we have positioned the roots to simplify our figures.

\textbf{Case 1.}
$T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move, so $((T)_t,(T)_{t+1})$ is an edge in $T$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni1}.
Denote the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_t$ by $A$ and $B$ and the cluster induced by the child of $(T)_{t+1}$ that is not $(T)_t$ by $C$, and assume that the $\nni$ move between $T$ and $T'$ exchanges the subtrees induced by clusters $B$ and $C$.
Additionally, denote the cluster induced by the child of $(T)_{t+2}$ that is not $(T)_{t+1}$ by $D$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{thm_fp_nni1}
\caption{$\nni$ move between $T$ and $T'$ on the bold edge $((T)_t,(T)_{t+1})$ and the third $\rnni$ neighbour resulting from a move on that edge.}
\label{fig:thm_fp_nni1}
\end{figure}

We now consider all possible moves $\findpath$ can perform to go from $T$ to $T_1$ that involve a node of rank $t$ or $t+1$, that is, we will consider three intervals in total.

\begin{enumerate}[label = 1.{\arabic*}]
\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_t, (T)_{t+1}]$.
Note that this move has to be the $\nni$ move that is different from the $\nni$ move connecting $T$ and $T'$.

In this case, the cluster $B \cup C$ is built in $T_1$, as depicted in the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni1}.
It follows that the cluster $C_k$ that is considered first by $\findpath$ must contain elements from both $B$ and $C$.
But then $\findpath$ applied to $T'$ and $R$ has to decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ in its first step implying that $T'_1 = T_1$, so $|\fp(T',R)| = |\fp(T,R)|$.
This contradicts our assumption that $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$ that swaps the subtrees induced by clusters $C$ and $D$.
This move is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} by an arrow from $T$ to the leftmost tree in the middle row.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Comparison of paths $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ if $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move on edge $((T)_{t+1},T_{t+2})$ in $T$.
	The bottom row displays all possibilities for $T_2$ and $T'_2$, depending on the position of cluster $C_k$ that is considered by $\findpath$:
	${C_k \subseteq B \cup D}$ is on the left, ${C_k \subseteq A \cup D}$ is in the middle, ${C_k \subseteq C \cup D}$ is on the right.}
	\label{fig:thm_fp_nni}
\end{figure}

Note that the cluster $C_k$ that is considered by $\findpath$ in the first step of computing $\fp(T, R)$ must intersect $D$.
Additionally, $C_k$ must intersect $A$, or $B$, or both of them.
Hence, we will consider each of these three cases individually.

We will use Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni} to demonstrate all the three cases below.

\begin{enumerate}[label = \theenumi.\arabic*]
\item $C_k$ intersects each of $A$, $B$, and $D$.
We can assume $k > 1$ and $C_{k-1} = (R)_{k-1}$ as $C_1$ contains two elements and can therefore only intersect with either $A$ or $B$.
Since $C_k$ is the first cluster considered by $\findpath$, the two clusters that make up $C_k$ in $R$ must be present in $T$.
So $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$.
Since $A \cup B$ is not a cluster in $T'$, $\findpath$ will decrease the rank of $(C_{k-1})_{T'}$ on $\fp(T', R)$ before considering cluster $C_k$.
Note that the clusters induced by nodes of rank $i < k - 1$ in $T$ and $T'$ coincide, so all moves, if any, on $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ that involve those cluster will be the same.
The $\rnni$ move decreases the rank of $(C_{k-1})_{T'}$ by building cluster $A \cup B$, in which case $T'_1 = T$.
This however contradicts $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

\item $C_k \subseteq A \cup D$.
\label{deep_case_details}
Starting from $T$, $\findpath$ exchanges first subtrees induced by clusters $C$ and $D$ and then by $B$ and $D$.
This results in trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ -- see the path leading to the tree in the middle of the bottom row in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.
Starting from $T'$, $\findpath$ exchanges first subtrees induced by $B$ and $D$ and then by $C$ and $D$.
This results in trees $T_1'$ and $T_2'$ -- see the path leading to the tree in the middle of the bottom row in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}.
It follows that $T_2$ and $T'_2$ only differ by one interval (indicated by dotted edges in the corresponding trees in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni}), and hence they are $\rnni$ neighbours.
This together with the facts that $|\fp(T_2,R)| = |\fp(T,R)|-2$ and $|\fp(T'_2,R)| = |\fp(T',R)|-2$ contradicts the assumption that $|\fp(T,R)|$ is a minimal length violating inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}).

\item $C_k \subseteq B \cup D$.
This case is analogous to the previous one.
The two initial segments of $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ are the paths leading to the leftmost trees in the bottom row of Figures~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} and \ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}, respectively.
Note that the rank swap leading from $T_1'$ to $T_2'$ is required because the rank of $(C_k)_R$ is at most $t$ as implied by the move leading from $T_1$ to $T_2$.
The corresponding trees $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are again $\rnni$ neighbours.
\end{enumerate}

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$ that builds a cluster $C \cup D$ in $T_1$.
\label{case:one_or_two_moves_down}
This move is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a} by an arrow from $T$ to the second leftmost tree in the middle row.
In this case, $C_k \subseteq C \cup D$.

If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$ is a cluster in $R$.
Since $A \cup B$ is not a cluster in $T'$, the first $\rnni$ move on $\fp(T', R)$ builds the cluster $A \cup B$ by swapping subtrees induced by cluster $B$ and $C$.
This move results in $T_1' = T$ contradicting $|\fp(T',R)| < |\fp(T,R)| - 1$.

If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
This results in the path from $T$ to the rightmost tree in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2a}.
Hence, $\fp(T', R)$ also has to begin with two moves that decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ twice, resulting in the rightmost path in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_nni2b}.
Similarly to case~\ref{deep_case_details}, we arrive at a contradiction that trees $T_2$, $T_2'$, and $R$ violate inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) and $|\fp(T_2,R)| < |\fp(T,R)|$.

\item Rank move on interval $[(T)_{t+1},(T)_{t+2}]$.
\label{case:rank_move_interval_above}
This case is analogous to case~\ref{case:one_or_two_moves_down}.
If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A \cup B$ is a cluster in $R$, and applying $\findpath$ to $T', R$ we get $T'_1 = T$.
If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
Recall that the interval between nodes of rank $t$ and $t+1$ is an edge in both $T$ and $T'$.
Hence, the first two moves on $\fp(T', R)$ decrease the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ twice resulting in $T'_2$ which is an $\rnni$ neighbour of $T_2$.
As before, this contradicts our minimality assumption.

\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_{t-1},(T)_t]$.
In this case $C_k \subseteq A \cup B$, so the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T'}$ by exchanging the subtrees induced by $B$ and $C$.
This results in $T'_1 = T$.
This argument applies whether or not $((T)_{t-1},(T)_t)$ is an edge in $T$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Case 2.}
$T$ and $T'$ are connected by a rank move on the interval between nodes of rank $t$ and $t+1$.
Denote the cluster induced by $(T)_t$ by $A$, the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_t$ by $A_1$ and $A_2$, the cluster induced by $(T)_{t+1}$ by $B$, and the clusters induced by the children of $(T)_{t+1}$ by $B_1$ and $B_2$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{thm_fp_rank1}
\caption{Rank move between $T$ and $T'$ on the interval above the node of rank $t$, and possible initial segments of $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$.
We use notations $A = A_1 \cup A_2$ and $B = B_1 \cup B_2$.}
\label{fig:thm_fp_rank1}
\end{figure}

We again consider all possible moves $\findpath$ can perform to go from $T$ to $T_1$ that involve a node of rank $t$ or $t+1$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = 2.\arabic*]
\item Rank move on $[(T)_t,(T)_{t+1}]$.
This move results in $T_1 = T'$.

\item $\nni$ move on (edge) interval $[(T)_{t+1},(T)_{t+2}]$.
The following two sub-cases are analogous to case~\ref{case:one_or_two_moves_down}.

\begin{enumerate}[label = \theenumi.\arabic*]
	\item $(T)_{t+2}$ is a parent of $(T)_t$.
	The first move on $\fp(T, R)$ builds a cluster $A \cup B_1$ or $A \cup B_2$, and we assume without loss of generality that it is the former, as in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	This implies that $C_k \subseteq A \cup B_1$.
	If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A$ is a cluster in $R$.
	Therefore, the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ decreases the rank of $(A)_{T'}$, which results in $T_1' = T$.
	If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step.
	Due to the symmetry we can assume that $C_k \subseteq A_1 \cup B_1$, which implies that the move between $T_1$ to $T_2$ exchanges the subtrees induced by $A_2$ and $B_1$, as depicted on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	$C_k \subseteq A_1 \cup B_1$ implies that the first two moves on $\fp(T', R)$ result in a tree $T'_2$ that is an $\rnni$ neighbour of $T_2$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank1}.
	This is a contradiction to the minimality assumption on $|\fp(T,R)|$.

	\item $(T)_{t+2}$ is not a parent of $(T)_t$.
	In this case, there exists a cluster $C$ induced by the child of $(T)_{t+2}$ which is different from the one that induces $B$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{thm_fp_rank2}
	\caption{Comparison of paths $\fp(T, R)$ and $\fp(T', R)$ if there is a rank move between $T$ and $T'$ and an $\nni$ move on the edge below the corresponding (rank) interval follows on $\fp(T, R)$.}
	\label{fig:thm_fp_rank2}
\end{figure}
	We can assume without loss of generality that $C_k \subseteq C \cup B_1$ and the first move on $\fp(T, R)$ builds a new cluster $C \cup B_1$.
	If the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide then $C_{k-1} = A$ is a cluster in $R$, which implies that $A$ is induced by the node of rank $t$ in both $T$ and $R$.
	So $T'_1 = T$.
	If the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ is strictly higher than that of $(C_k)_R$ then $\findpath$ decreases the rank of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ in the second step -- see Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}.
	The corresponding first moves on $\fp(T', R)$ are shown on the right in Figure~\ref{fig:thm_fp_rank2}, and we again get that $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are $\rnni$ neighbours.
\end{enumerate}

\item Rank move on interval $[(T)_{t+1}, (T)_{t+2}]$.
Again, depending on whether or not the ranks of $(C_k)_{T_1}$ and $(C_k)_R$ coincide, we arrive at the conclusion that either $T_1' = T$ or $T_2$ and $T_2'$ are $\rnni$ neighbours, similar to case~\ref{case:rank_move_interval_above}.

\item $\rnni$ move on interval $[(T)_{t-1},(T)_t]$.
In this case $C_k \subseteq A$ and the first move on $\fp(T', R)$ must be a rank swap resulting in $T_1' = T$.
\end{enumerate}

Since all possible cases result in a contradiction, we conclude that inequality~(\ref{eqn:iff_inequality}) is true for all trees, which completes the proof of the theorem.
\endproof


\section{Applications}

In this section we apply Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial} to settle further open problems about the $\rnni$ graph.

\subsection{Cluster Property}

\summary{Some words on the cluster property}
Historically in mathematical phylogenetics, the shortest path decision problem was studied hand in hand with the following cluster property \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.
We say that a graph on trees has the \emph{cluster property} if two trees $T$ and $R$ sharing a cluster implies that all trees on every shortest path between $T$ and $R$ also have this cluster.
Surprisingly, this property does not hold for the $\nni$ graph \autocite{Li1996-zw}.
Interestingly, the property has been crucial for proving \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa} that the shortest path problem in $\nni$ is $\np$-hard.
In this section, we will prove that the $\rnni$ graph has the cluster property by building on the fact that $\findpath$ computes shortest paths that preserve clusters.
Note that since paths computed by $\findpath$ preserve clusters, it follows directly that there always exists a shortest path that maintains every shared cluster.
However, the cluster property is universal and hence requires a proof that \textbf{all} shortest paths have this property.

\summary{Proving the Cluster Property for $\rnni$}

\begin{corollary}
Let $T$ and $R$ be two trees sharing a cluster $C$ and $p$ a shortest path from $T$ to $R$ in $\rnni$.
Then every tree on $p$ contains the cluster $C$.
\label{cluster_thm}
\end{corollary}

\proof
Assume to the contrary that $T$, $R$, $C$, and $p$ is a courter-example to the statement.
We can assume that no counterexample exists for paths shorter than $p$, so the first tree $T'$ after $T$ on $p$ does not contain the cluster $C$.
Therefore $T$ and $T'$ are connected by an $\nni$ move that moves a subtrees rooted at a child of $(C)_T$ out of the subtree induced by $C$ -- see Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_thm_proof}, where by $C_1$, $C_2$ we denote the clusters induced by the children of $(C)_T$.
Note that the only clusters in $T$ that distinguish $T$ from $T'$ are $C$ and the cluster induced by the node right above $(C)_{T}$, which is of the same rank as $(C)_{T'}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{cluster_thm_proof}
\caption{Neighbouring trees $T$ and $T'$, where $T$ contains the cluster $C = C_1 \cup C_2$ and $T'$ does not.
Dashed lines indicate identical parts of trees.}
\label{fig:cluster_thm_proof}
\end{figure}

Since $T$ and $R$ have the minimum distance among all counterexamples to the statement of the corollary, we can assume, using the same argument as in the beginning of proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial}, that $C$ is the first cluster considered by $\findpath$ on $\fp(T, R)$.
But in this case, the first move on $\fp(T',R)$ builds the cluster $C$ and results in tree $T$, which is a contradiction.
\endproof

\subsection{Generalisation to discrete time-trees}

\summary{Generalising $\findpath$ for discrete time-trees}
In this section we will show how to modify the $\findpath$ algorithm to efficiently solve the shortest path problem for \emph{discrete time-trees} \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.
These are trees where all internal nodes are uniquely ranked by elements of the set $\{1, \ldots, m\}$, where $m \geq n - 1$, so that children have strictly smaller ranks than their parents.
The NNI and rank moves are supplemented by a third type of move called a \emph{length move}, which changes (increases or decreases) the rank of an internal node by one without changing the rank of any other node in the tree.
So a length move implies that the length of one of the intervals $[(T)_{t+1},(T)_t]$ or $[(T)_t,(T)_{t-1}]$ increases by one and the other one decreases by one.
Note that $\nni$ moves are still only allowed on (edge) intervals bounded by consecutive nodes.

A natural extension of $\findpath$ to discrete time-trees is to simply add all the necessary length moves when a most recent common ancestor needs to be moved down to a particular level.
\begin{corollary}
The time complexity of the shortest path problem between discrete time-trees with $n$ leaves and node ranks bounded by $m$ is $\O(nm)$.
\label{cor:fp_dtt}
\end{corollary}

\proof
Let $T$ and $R$ be a pair of discrete time-trees.
We will convert $T$ and $R$ into $\rnni$ trees on $m + 1$ leaves and show that the modified version of $\findpath$ for discrete time-trees is equivalent to the original $\findpath$ on converted trees.
To receive $T'$ from $T$, an internal node with rank $m + 1$ is added as new root that has the tree $T$ as one child and a tree with leaves labelled by $a_{n + 1}, \ldots, a_{m + 1}$ as second child.
In this second subtree internal nodes have as ranks positive integers below $m$ for which there is no internal node of this rank in $T$.
The internal node of lowest rank in this subtree has leaves $a_{n + 1}$ and $a_{n + 2}$ as children and every other node has the next internal node of lower rank in this subtree and a leaf as child, such that the ranks of parents of leaves are increasing with the indices $n + 1, \ldots, m + 1$ of the leaves.
The resulting tree $T'$ does not contain intervals of length greater than one.
The same way we obtain tree $R'$ from $R$.

Now, a path $p$ between $T$ and $R$ can be transformed to a path $p'$ between $T'$ and $R'$ so that $|p| = |p'|$ by exchanging all length moves on $p$ to rank swaps on $p'$.
All rank moves and $\nni$ moves on $p'$ remain the same as on $p$.
In particular, this transformation matches the moves along $\fp(T,R)$ and $\fp(T',R')$ and Theorem~\ref{thm:rnni_polynomial} implies that $\fp(T, R)$ is a shortest path.
\endproof

Interestingly and in line with this result, the shortest path (geodesic) problem is polynomial time computable in the continuous space of time-trees \autocite{Gavryushkin2016-uu}, where intervals can be of arbitrary real-valued lengths.
Note that Corollaries~\ref{cor:fp_dtt} and \ref{cluster_thm} imply that the space of discrete time-trees has the cluster property as well.


\section{For what $\rho$ is $\decprob{\rho}$ polynomial?}

\summary{Summarising results on complexity of $\decprob{\rho}$ -- $\decprob{1} \in \p$ and $\decprob{0} \in \np$}
As we have seen in Section~\ref{sec:rnni_complexity}, the shortest path problem $\decprob{1}$ is solvable in polynomial time.
In this section, we will show that a classical result in mathematical phylogenetics implies that $\decprob{0}$ is $\np$-hard.
We will also discuss $\decprob{\rho}$ for other values of $\rho$.

\begin{proposition}
Let $p = [T_1, \ldots, T_m]$ be a path in $\rnni(0)$ and $p'$ a path in $\nni$ that results from ignoring rankings of internal nodes in all trees on $p$ and deleting duplicated trees.
Then $p'$ a path in $\nni$ between the trees resulting from the first and last tree of $p$ b ignoring their rankings, and it is $|p| = |p'|$, where $|p|$ is the weight of $p$.
\end{proposition}

\proof
The only moves on $p$ with weight greater than zero are $\nni$ moves.
Therefore the length of $p$ equals the number of $\nni$ moves on this path.
And as transforming $p$ into $p'$ as described above deletes all rank moves and none of the $\nni$ moves, the lengths of $p$ and $p'$ coincide.
\endproof

\summary{Complexity of $\decprob{\rho}$ changes somewhere between zero and one -- where remains an open question}
In particular, this result implies that shortest paths in $\rnni(0)$ give shortest paths in $\nni$.
Since \textcite{Dasgupta2000-xa} proved that computing distances in $\nni$ is $\np$-hard, we can conclude the same for $\rnni(0)$.
So the complexity of computing the ranked nearest neighbour interchange distance between trees depends on the weight of rank rearrangements and can change from quadratic, when rank moves are counted as one rearrangement, to $\np$-hard, when rank moves are ignored.
It hence is natural to ask whether a boundary exists at which the problem switches from polynomial to hard.

\begin{question}
Is there a threshold $r \in [0,1]$ for which $\decprob{\rho} \in \np$ for all $\rho \leq r$, and $\decprob{\rho} \in \p$ for all $\rho > r$?
\end{question}

\summary{Getting one step closer to answer this question by considering small neighbourhoods for $\rho$ around zero and one}
In order to get one step closer to answering this question, we can consider $\decprob{\rho}$ for $\rho$ close to zero or one and see that in such small neighbourhoods the complexity is the same as in $\decprob{0}$ and $\decprob{1}$, respectively.

\begin{proposition}
There exists $\delta > 0$ such that the shortest path problem is $\np$-hard in $\rnni(\varepsilon)$ for all $\varepsilon < \delta$.
\label{thm:complexity_around_nni}
\end{proposition}

\proof
Let $r$ be the number of edges in the $\rnni$ graph that represent rank moves and $\delta = \frac{1}{r}$.
We will prove the theorem by reducing the shortest path problem in $\rnni(\epsilon)$ for $\epsilon < \delta$ to the shortest path problem in $\nni$.
In order to prove this we show that for each pair of trees $T$ and $R$ a shortest path in $\rnni(\delta)$ gives a shortest path in $\nni$ by ignoring all rank moves.
The distance $d_{\rnni(\epsilon)}(T,R)$ is the length of a shortest path in $\rnni(\epsilon)$ and can therefore be seen as $d_{\rnni(\epsilon)}(T,R) = m_n + \epsilon \cdot m_r$ where $m_n$ is the number of $\nni$ moves and $m_r$ the number of rank moves on a shortest path.
For contradiction we assume that $d_{\nni}(T,R) < m_n$, which means that there is a shortest path in $\rnni(\epsilon)$ where ignoring all rank moves does not result in a shortest path in $\nni$.
Let $p'$ be a shortest path in $\nni$ between the trees $T'$ to $R'$ which result from $T$ and $R$ by ignoring the rankings, respectively.
This path $p'$ can be extended to a path $p$ from $T$ to $R$ in $\rnni(\epsilon)$ by adding some rank moves.
However, this results in $|p| \leq r \cdot \epsilon + |p'| < r \cdot \delta + m_n < m_n$ which contradicts $d_{\rnni(\epsilon)}(T,R) = m_n + \epsilon \cdot m_r$.
\endproof

\begin{proposition}
There exists $\delta > 0$ such that the shortest path problem can be solved in polynomial time with the $\findpath$ algorithm in $\rnni(1-\varepsilon)$ for $\varepsilon < \delta$.
\end{proposition}

\proof
Analogous to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:complexity_around_nni} we define $r$ as the number of edges in $\rnni$ representing rank moves and $\delta = \frac{1}{r}$.
We prove the theorem by contradiction and assume that there is an $\varepsilon < \delta$ and a pair of trees $T,R$ in $\rnni(1-\varepsilon)$ for which there is a path $p'$ in $\rnni(1-\varepsilon)$ that is shorter than $\fp(T,R)$.
If $m_n$ is the number of $\nni$ moves on $p'$ and $m_r$ the number of rank moves, it is $|p'| = m_n + m_r \cdot (1 - \varepsilon)$.
The path $p$ in $\rnni(1)$ containing the same trees as $p'$ is then has length $|p| = |p'| + m_r \cdot \epsilon < |p'| + m_r \cdot \frac{1}{r} \leq |p'| < |\fp(T,R)|$.
This however contradicts the fact that $\findpath$ computes shortest paths in $\rnni(1)$, which proves the theorem.
\endproof

\summary{Rank moves and $\nni$ moves can appear in different proportions on shortest paths and this is related to $\fp$ not computing shortest paths if $\rho \neq 1$}
When considering the problem of characterising the complexity of computing the distance in $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho \neq 0,1$, an important question is how to balance the trade off between $\nni$ and rank moves.
Indeed, examples exist when different shortest paths between trees have different number of $\nni$ moves, that is, some $\nni$ moves can be traded for rank moves.
The following observation, which follows from the existence of such different shortest paths, provides a first step towards understanding of this trade off using the $\findpath$ algorithm.

\begin{lemma}
	$\findpath$ does not compute shortest paths for $\rnni(\rho)$ with $\rho > 1$.
\end{lemma}
